This program demonstrates how to automate interactions with a calendar or date picker on a web page using Selenium WebDriver and WebDriverManager with Firefox. Hereâ€™s a concise summary of what the program does:
WebDriver Setup: Utilizes WebDriverManager to automatically download and configure the appropriate FirefoxDriver.
Browser Initialization: Initializes an instance of FirefoxDriver and maximizes the browser window for better visibility.
Navigation: Navigates to a sample web page that contains a date picker element.
Date Picker Interaction: Clicks on the date picker input field to open the calendar interface. It then iterates through the date elements within the calendar, selects the date "27", and clicks on it.
This automation script provides a practical example of handling date picker elements in web applications, showcasing the simplicity and power of using Selenium WebDriver in combination with WebDriverManager.
